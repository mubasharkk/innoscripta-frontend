# [Frontend](https://github.com/mubasharkk/innoscripta-frontend)
* The app is very basic and simple displaying the list of articles and having a search filters by `keyword` (title only), `source`, `dates` , `author`
* Setup is simple
    * `npm install`
    * `npm run dev`

**Tech Note:**  The react-js frontend is build on using `nextjs` framework. I don't have extensive expertise in `nextjs` so I have to look and reuse/modify some code from other sources available online.
The app has very basic setup and functionality and there is a lot of refactor special using proper SSR and its components.

The backend API data fetching can be added to config file, but currently they are using the domain `http://localhost:8080` and that is recommnded for the backend app.
